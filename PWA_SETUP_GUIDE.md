## 📱 Generate Icons

### Option 1: Use the Icon Generator (Easiest)
1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Icons will be generated automatically
3. Click "Download All" button
4. Save the downloaded files to the `/public` folder:
   - `icon-192.png`
   - `icon-512.png`
   - `apple-touch-icon.png`

### Option 2: Create Your Own Icons
Create PNG images with these specs:
- **192x192px** - For Android home screen
- **512x512px** - For splash screen and app stores
- **180x180px** - For iOS home screen (name it `apple-touch-icon.png`)

**Design Tips:**
- Use your brand colors (green gradient: #10b981 → #059669)
- Include the EcoRewards logo/icon
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Make sure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds

## 🧪 Testing Your PWA

### Local Testing:
1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Open Chrome DevTools:**
   - Press `F12`
   - Go to **Application** tab
   - Check **Manifest** section (should show no errors)
   - Check **Service Workers** section (should be registered)

3. **Test Install:**
   - Look for install button in address bar (+ icon)
   - Or use Chrome menu → "Install EcoRewards"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Service Worker not registering?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're on HTTPS (or localhost)
- Clear browser cache and hard reload

**Icons not showing?**
- Verify file names match manifest.json
- Check file paths are correct
- Make sure icons are accessible (test URL directly)

**Install prompt not appearing?**
- PWA criteria must be met (manifest, service worker, HTTPS)
- User hasn't dismissed it before
- Chrome may delay showing prompt based on engagement

**Caching issues?**
- Update `CACHE_NAME` version in service-worker.js
- Clear application cache in DevTools
- Force service worker update
